# Calc-II-Sequences-and-Series
The purpose of this Notebook is to explain the difference between convergence of an infinite sequence and convergence of an infinite series. An analogy is made with convergence of a function versus convergence of its integral. The relationship to the Divergence Test is also discussed.
