# Calc-II-Sequences-and-Series
The purpose of this Notebook is to explain the difference between convergence of an infinite sequence and convergence of an infinite series. An analogy is made with convergence of a function versus convergence of its integral. The relationship to the Divergence Test is also discussed. 

You can either download the files and run the Notebook on your local machine or you can launch the Notebook by clicking on the mybinder.org link below.

If you download the files to your computer make sure that you have the SeriesTools.py file: these are the backend functions that create the simulations in the notebook.
